# Instructions for Museum of Science
## Tinkerbook Study

*(revised 2013-06-10)*

## Things to make sure you have

- Clipboard 
- 2 Pens 
- at least 10 consent forms printed out
- XOOM tablet with Tinkerbook_MOS installed and fully charged
- XOOM power charger
- Video Camera
- Tripod
- Digital Recorder (can use iPhone)
- Directional Microphone
- picture of African Children

## Goals 

We're partnering with the Living Laboratory to conduct design research.   For this phase of the study, we are trying to illicit a baseline set of spoken language that parents and children use when interacting around a reading application on a tablet. This spoken language will be analyzed by our collaborators to generate some expert-driven prompting in the book (ex. can we use language that parents seem to use to have the book, itself, generate more language via a character prompting the users to discuss what's happening on the page).

We will create a proper, randomized session after having multiple conditions built.

## Setup

The museum staff may be able to help with some of this setup:

- plugin Xoom to power strip by table
- arrange child-size seats to be side by side
- arrange reading pillow on floor 
- move whiteboard w/ study name onto table
- set up camera and microphone to capture the general reading area


## Script

*(exit out of any playing app on tablet.  You should be on the main tablet screen with the single tinkerbook icon in the middle.  If charged, remove tablet from power cord.  Sit on floor near table or on step to be near the adult/child pair.)*

(*Turn on camera and recorders*)

*(to Child)* Hello. My name is _____.  What is your name?  <br/>

I'm very pleased to meet you! (indicating to adult) and who is this? 

I'm a researcher from MIT, and I am studying how children and parents read and play together using technology like this tablet (*show XOOM, but don't let go of it yet*).  Have you ever seen something like this before?


I'm going to ask you to read a story together on this tablet about a Baby Duck.  You should talk about what you see on the screen.  You can tap or swipe on pictures and words you see. I'm going to sit here quietly while you read together; try to pretend like I'm not even here.  When you are done with the story, or if you get tired or bored with the story, just let me know. Are you ready to start?

(*turn the power on and place the tablet in front of the child or hand to the parent if they are sitting together on the floor*)

(*Wait and watch the interaction*)

Thank you so much. (*take back the tablet*).  May I ask you a couple of questions before you go?
