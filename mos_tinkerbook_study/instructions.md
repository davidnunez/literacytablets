# Instructions for Museum of Science
## Tinkerbook Study

*(revised 2013-06-21)*

## Equipment

- Clipboard 
	- 2 Pens 
	- 10+ consent forms printed out
	- picture of African Children
	- business cards
- 2 XOOM tablet with Tinkerbook_MOS installed and fully charged
- 1 XOOM power charger
- Video Camera
- Digital Recorder (ex. iPhone)
- Directional Microphone
- laptop to use with Directional Microphone
- Tripod (*Should already be at MoS*) 
- Stickers (*Should already be at MoS*)
- Digital Recorder (w usb input) (*We don't have this, yet, as of 2013-06-21*)

## Goals 

We're partnering with the Living Laboratory to conduct design research.   For this phase of the study, we are trying to illicit a baseline set of spoken language that parents and children use when interacting around a reading application on a tablet. This spoken language will be analyzed by our collaborators to generate some expert-driven prompting in the book (ex. can we use language that parents seem to use to have the book, itself, generate more language via a character prompting the users to discuss what's happening on the page).

We will create a proper, randomized session after having multiple conditions built.

## Setup

*The museum staff may be able to help*

1.	Push the table farther back against the wall.
2.	Move the small wooden chairs so they are side-by-side by the window.
3.	Get a blue cushion and pillow for reading on the floor. Put these where the bench usually is (slide the bench toward the animal terrariums).
4.	Move the whiteboard with the study question onto the table.
5.	Plug in the XOOM charger to the power strip by the table. Charge either tablet.
6.	Turn both tablets on.
7.	Set up the tripod to the right of the table, in front of the cupboards by the engineering station.
8.	Put the camera on the tripod, and plug the camera into the power strip.
9.	Point the camera at either the chairs or the cushion on the floor – you will need to reposition based on where people sit!
10.	Set up Directional microphone on table and plug into laptop w/ recording program
11.	Make sure you have consent forms, the script, stickers, and the inserts about the study ready.

## Script
**Things to say when recruiting parents:**

- We’re interested in parent-child reading behavior.
- We’d like to see how parents and children read ebooks and interactive stories together.
- We want to find out how reading an ebook is different from reading a traditional book.

**After you have obtained consent (or when taking a non-participant through the experience):**

**If you didn't actually take the consent form or see your partner take the form, be sure to verify the adult has given informed consent.  Ask if they have seen the form and if they are aware and give permission for you to be recording audio and video.**

- *Incrementally number each consent form so we can match to captured audio/video.*
- *Exit out of any playing app on tablet. You should be on the main tablet screen with the single tinkerbook icon in the middle.*
- *If charged, remove tablet from power cord.*
- *IF CONSENT: Turn on the camera and recorders.*
- *Sit on the floor near the table or on the step – near the adult/child pair.*


Hello. My name is _____. What is your name?

I’m very pleased to meet you! (indicating to caregiver) and who is this?

I’m a researcher from MIT, and I am studying how children and adults read and play together with tablets, like this one.
- *Show XOOM, but don’t let go of it yet.*

Have you ever seen something like this before? (*ask for clarification if they only say “yes”*)

I’m going to ask you to read a story together on this tablet about a baby duck. Feel free to talk about what you see on the screen. You can tap or swipe on pictures and words. When you are done reading, or if you get tired or bored, just let me know. Are you ready to start?

- *Turn the power on and place the tablet in front of the child or hand to the parent if they are sitting together on the floor*
- *Let them read the story!*
 
**When they are done reading:**

Thank you so much. 

- *Take back the tablet.*

May I ask you a couple of questions before you go?

## Survey (Recorded answers)

### To Child

1.	What did you like best about the Baby D story?
2.	What did you like least about the Baby D story?
3.	How often do you read books at home or school?
4.	Do you usually read by yourself or with other people?
5.	How old are you? (you can ask the caregiver if the child is uncooperative)

### To Caregiver

- What did you think about the story?
- Do you have any suggestions for us to improve the reading experience?


### Debriefing (NOT OPTIONAL)
Thank you again for helping us out! **Would you like a sticker?**

Lots of adults read with kids on tablets and ipads. We want to see how reading on a tablet is different from reading a traditional book.

We also want to use all the great reading behaviors you guys exhibit to add an interactive character to the baby duck story who encourages all those behaviors. This might be useful for parents who may not use these behaviors, or for kids who are reading on their own – maybe reading an interactive story with a character who reads like you is better than just watching TV.

Do you have any other questions about our research or future goals?

Thanks again!

### Teardown
- The Tripod gets stored in the volunteer room.
- All other equipment returns to the lab.
- Give tablet and camera to David for processing ( dnunez@media.mit.edu )
